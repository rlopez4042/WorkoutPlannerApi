Users can use our application to create customized workouts. Users can also add and delete exercises in each individual workout. Each exercise includes a field for the exercise name, reps, sets, and a description. Clicking on the Workout titles from the homepage displays all the exercises for that workout.

### Project Timeline

- On Monday we had our initial SCRUM and decided on a project in the morning.  The README.md was started over the weekend so we finalized the project and project description portions.  We started and completed the wireframes, filled out the priority table and finished everything to have our project approved.  At 2:30 we met with the instructional staff and they pruned our MVP to more realistic expectations.  After approval we structured the back end and started the models and controllers.
- On Tuesday we continued the controllers and approached MVP for back end.  Once tested the backend to satisfactory results we began the front end structure and framework.  At this point we began having issues with the accessing the backend CRUD with the frontend and began to work through bugs.
- In the afternoon on Wednesday we continued working on issues with the frontend communicating with the backend.  To solve this problem we restructured the backend models and added CRUD functionality.  Other issues with getting additional features in the front end to communicate with the backend persisted into Thursday.
- On Thursday we continued to work on getting the additional MVP features on the frontend to communicate with the back.
