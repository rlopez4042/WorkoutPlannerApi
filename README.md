## Project Description

- Work out app
    - A workout app where users can input their own workouts, each workout can be divided into two types, cardio and weight-lifting. Weight-lifting workouts will include a section for workout, reps and sets and each cardio workout will include a workout, distance, time. Users can also add a description for each workout.

### Workout Schema

| ---------- | --------- | :------: | ---------------- |
| Robert | Lopez | enter goals here | ### | 
| Isaiah | Keller | generally more fit and healthy | 210 |
| Garrett | Pyke | goals | ### |
| Corey | Villanueva | goals | ### |


**Weight Lifting**
| Exercise    | Reps     | Sets     | Weekdays | Description        |
| ----------- | :------: | :------: | :--------: | ------------------ |
